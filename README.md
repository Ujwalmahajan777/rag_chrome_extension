# üß† AI-Powered RAG Chrome Extension

A Chrome Extension integrated with a **FastAPI backend** and **LangChain RAG pipeline** that lets you **query any webpage‚Äôs content directly from your browser**.

Instead of manually reading through long articles or documentation, you can:
1. Load the webpage into the extension.
2. Ask a natural language question.
3. Get precise, webpage-specific answers instantly.

## üìå Why This Project?
The internet is full of long-form content ‚Äî technical documentation, research papers, news articles.  
While valuable, **finding exactly what you need can be time-consuming**.

This project bridges the gap between **raw web content** and **fast, context-aware question answering**.  
Using **Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)**, it:
- Retrieves only the most relevant chunks of the page.
- Uses an **LLM (DeepSeek)** to generate concise answers.
